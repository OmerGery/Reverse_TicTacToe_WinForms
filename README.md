# C# .NET Winforms - Reverse TicTacToe Game
### By Omer Gery & Daniel Dolev.
The Game is implemented by an Object-Oriented Win Form Application in the .NET Framework.

There are 2 forms - game settings implemented with the .NET Designer.

The other is the Game itself - a dynamic form - therefore it's implemented manually - a buttons matrix.

## To Play The Game:

1.Download the zip or clone the repository. 

2.Open the folder "Play Game".

3.Click on "PlayGame!.exe".

4.Enjoy!
