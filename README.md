# C# .NET Winforms - Reverse TicTacToe Game
### By Omer Gery & Daniel Dolev.

The Game is implemented by an Object-Oriented Win Form Application in the .NET Framework.

The user can play either against a friend or against the computer - an AI algorithm.

The solution is using sound resources.

The Logic ("backend") is implemented in the Logic Project, which produces a dll.

The UI ("frontend) is implemented in the UI Project , it references the logic dll and produces an exe file.

There are 2 forms - game settings implemented with the .NET Designer.

The other is the Game itself - a dynamic form - therefore it's implemented manually - a buttons matrix.

## To Play The Game:

1.Download the zip or clone the repository. 

2.Open the folder "Play Game".

3.Click on "PlayGame!.exe".

4.Enjoy!
